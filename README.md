## research question
Do British Twitter users use the present perfect more when describing something that has recently occurred?

Hundt, 2009 states that in both American English and British English the use of the present perfect is decreasing. It also says that in the 1990s the present perfect was significantly more often used in British English than in American English. This leads to the following **hypothesis**:
Twitter users from the UK will more often use the present perfect than Twitter users from the US.
